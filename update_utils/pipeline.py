"""
Pipeline entrypoint — runs the three stages in order:

  1. Markets — full market list from the CLOB API (runs to completion FIRST)
  2. Chain   — OrderFilled events via HyperSync
  3. Process — join orders ↔ markets into labeled trades

Markets is fetched first so the complete list exists before any trade is
scraped or processed. Each stage is independently resumable; subsequent runs
only pull deltas.

Exposed as the `poly-data` console script (see pyproject) so `uv run poly-data`
runs the whole pipeline.
